## ACDC ISA -  The Architecture Created for Division Calculation

The Architecture Created for Division Calculation (ACDC) ISA was developed for the purpose of optimizing the given program for this lab which consist mostly of division. By optimizing the architecture specifically for the lab, we manage to develop an ISA that consist of only 9-bits of instructions. In order to achieve this, ACDC provides 3 different types of instructions: R-type which consists of register-register functions, I-type which consists of register-immediate functions, and O-type which consists of other type of instructions such as shift and branch.
